## Prerequisites
Requires ganache. To install it (on Ubuntu 20.04) run:
```
sudo apt install npm
npm install -g ganache-cli
```
Installation is verified with:
```
ganache-cli --version
```
Which returns:
```
Ganache CLI v6.12.2 (ganache-core: 2.13.2)
```

## Step 1
```
git clone https://github.com/tellor-io/TellorCore.git
cd TellorCore
pip install git+https://chromium.googlesource.com/external/gyp
npm install
touch .env
#sudo chown -R 65534:1000 "/root/.npm"
#npm install -g truffle
npm i -g --unsafe-perm=true --allow-root truffle
```
Next, I changed some of the parameters in the `truffle-config.js` file as the localhost was not found at `localhost` but at `127.0.0.1`, and because the gas costs larger than the block cost set by ganache. I changed the `module.exports` to:
```
module.exports = {
  quiet: true,
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1", // changed from localhost to 127.0.0.1
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "*",
      gas: 1000000, // default ganache-cli value, removed a zero
    },
```
Next, I ran:
```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```


# Note, uninstallation commands are:
```
sudo npm uninstall truffle
```
Or simply deleting the repo as npm installs packages locally in the repository.
